## EtherDrive

**An on-chain car marketplace**

## Usage
To run tests, run `forge test`. 

A user can register in the system by calling registerUser(), and can then perform actions to manage their inventory, view all listed cars, create a listing of their own, or place a bid for a listing. After registering, the user will be assigned a User ID which they can use to place bids or create listings. All functionality happens within the Market.sol smart contract.
